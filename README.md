Tile flip pattern match game, created for my milestone project as part of the Full Stack Software Development course.

## UX

As a first time user, i want to play the easiest level, so I can learn how to play.
As a return user, I want to select my level, to choose the appropiate challenge.
As a frequent user, I want the best time displayed, so I can try to beat it.
